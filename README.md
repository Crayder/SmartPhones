Smart phones in SA-MP

This idea started with a bit of sarcasm, here: http://forum.sa-mp.com/showpost.php?p=3843517&postcount=2

I was just joking around but then I thought, "hell, why shouldn't this be made?" I didn't have any answers so I asked ItzzWesty (we were discussing the thread's screenshot, whether it was really a textdraw or not) who also thought it'd be a nice idea. Then I checked the thread again and seen a few others thought it'd be cool.
And now here this repository is...

If anyone wants to join in on this development feel free, we'll call it a community side project.


Features to come:

- [ ] "does it lose signal on Mt. Chiliad?" (absolute signal and no signal areas)
- [ ] "Does the battery die?" (charging battery will be required, charge at home or at restaurants and train stations)
- [ ] "Is the time synced?" (sync time textdraw with server time)
- [ ] "Do we get notifications?" (notifications will be in the chat, and an indicator textdraw will flash on the phone)
- [ ] "Do we get free wifi at Burger Shot or Well Stacked?" (wifi routers will be placed all over, some will even have passwords that must be given by administrators)
- [ ] "Do we get personal wifi at our house?" (players can pay for wifi at home?)
- [ ] Cell towers placed around San Andreas. Will lose signal with distance and number of object collisions between tower and players.
- [ ] Extensive cell plans with different abilities.
- [ ] Web pages/data using apps. Web pages will take 1mb each from player's data. Apps will use different amounts.
- [ ] Adding wifi to phone. Routers will have SSID's and passwords. Players will need to add the routers whether they have passwords or not. If they have a password the player will need to get it from someone.
- [ ] Texting, calling, data use.
- [ ] "Can we lose them?" (a chance of *dropping* phones while fighting, getting in/out vehicle, etc... will be notified and an object will be created)
- [ ] "Can we steal them?" (obvious)
- [ ] "Are there lock screens?" (pattern or pin code lockscreens)
- [ ] "DOES IT READ FINGERPRINTS?" (fingerprint reader for people with more expensive phones)
- [ ] Players will only have to unlock their phone when they first connect. After that they can use the fingerprint scanner (just a single click on the home button, like waking the phone up normally but with a message saying unlocked by fingerprint)
- [ ] When phones are lost and other players find them the lockscreen will appear and if you can't figure out the code the phone will drop again.
- [ ] When phones are charging the owner can't walk away or the phone will unplug and be lost until they pick it up and unlock it.
